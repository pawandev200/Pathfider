# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer application! This project is designed to provide an interactive and intuitive platform for visualizing the workings of popular graph algorithms in real time.

## ‚ú® Overview

This web application visualizes how algorithms like Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS navigate through a grid to find paths. Users can customize start points, endpoints, and obstacle placements, creating an engaging and educational way to explore pathfinding concepts.
